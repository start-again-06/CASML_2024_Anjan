Introduction

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are neural networks trained to satisfy physical laws described by differential equations. This implementation solves a PDE using a neural network and evaluates losses based on both interior points and boundary conditions.

Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas

Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pinn-pde-solver.git
cd pinn-pde-solver

Usage

Run the main script to train the model:

python main.py

Training the Model

The model is trained using:

Interior points: Sampled from within the domain

Boundary points: Sampled along the domain boundary

Loss function: Enforces the PDE and boundary conditions

The model consists of a feedforward neural network with hidden layers using tanh activation functions.

Generating Predictions

After training, the model generates predictions on test data and saves the results to a CSV file:

create_submission(model, test_path, submission_path)
